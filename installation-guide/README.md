# Installation Guide

{% hint style="info" %}
Owning a VPS is highly recommended. Although you can use sites such as repl.it or Heroku, they do not grant a full uptime and speed. However, you will find a guide to host the bot if you do not have a VPS in this documentation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 
{% endhint %}

In the following pages you will find a guide to setup your own ModMail instance. If you have any problems during the installation, please join the [support server](https://discord.gg/aUNhdFD).
