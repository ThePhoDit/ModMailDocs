* Disabling the **Public Bot** option is recommended so that only you can add the bot.

* Go to the **OAuth2** tab and select _Bot_ in the first checkbox list. Then select _Administrator_ in the second one. Copy the link and open it in your browser so that you can add the bot to your Discord server.
